Joint modeling has been a useful strategy for incorporating latent associations between different types of outcomes simultaneously in the last two decades. This dissertation contributes to the development of a multilevel Bayesian joint model, which is motivated by a longitudinal lung disease study. In Chapter \ref{chp1}, the background of Bayesian methodology for the joint modeling is introduced. Chapters \ref{chp2} and \ref{chp3} describe two novel joint models with applications to the cystic fibrosis disease. First, in Chapter \ref{chp2}, a multilevel joint model of longitudinal and binary outcomes with a flexible link function is proposed. Second, in Chapter \ref{chp3}, a multilevel joint model of longitudinal and time-to-recurrent event data is applied. Lastly, in Chapter \ref{chp4}, some key takeaways, limitations and future work are discussed.            

% In Chapter \ref{chp4}, a user-friendly interface RShiny is implemented for the dynamic individual predictions under the framework addressed in Chapter \ref{chp3}.
