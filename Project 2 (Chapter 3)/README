This repo provides example R code and Stan code used in the paper
'Multilevel Bayesian joint modeling for a longitudinal marker and time-to-recurrent event to characterize heterogeneity in multi-center studies'. 

With the code provided, the simulation for optimal joint model (association structure=current value, time scale=calendar) and corresponding two-stage method can be reproduced. 

The other simulation scenarios can be reproduced by slightly modifying the code. 

# Step 1. Generate simulated data

Generate simulated data list simJD by running the function sim_recJData(). The output simJD is a list contains longitudinal data (datLong) and recurrent data (datRec) and other information. The details are provided in the ExampleCode.R

# Step 2. Generate data list for Stan

Generate a data list simSD from the function get_SIMstandata() by the inputs of simulated data in Step 1. 
More details are provided in the ExampleCode.R

# Step 3. Read Stan models

Read in pre-defined Stan models by function cmdstan_model()

# Step 4. Execute two-stage method & joint model

Compile and run by model.name$sample()s
